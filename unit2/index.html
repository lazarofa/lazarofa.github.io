		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

		<p>The two websites I am most inspired by are <a href="http://bang.com.au" target="_blank">Bang</a> and <a href="http://www.frankdigital.com.au" target="_blank">Frank Digital</a>. They are both large digital agencies based in Sydney, Australia.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

		<p><strong>Bang</strong></p>

		<p>The Bang website uses negative space in the format of background white space and then the content is sitting within the positive space of the page. The primary focal point of the page is the carousel above the fold of the page which displays recent work from the agency which is the largest object on the page. The logo on the page works more like a secondary focal point to the user, being that the logo is quiet small compared to the other objects. The balance of the website is quite simple, with the logo in the top left hand corner and then the navigation to the right of the logo, and immediately following these two items is the full page width carousel. Below the fold the agency displays its most recent work using a three column grid layout.</p>

		<p><strong>Frank Digital</strong></p>

		<p>Frank Digital's website also uses white negative space with positive imagery and colours used across the page. The primary focal point is the large carousel and typography. The carousel displays their most recent work and the typography showcases their work and what sets them apart from their competitors. Below the carousel they display their menu with simple white text on a black background. Frank Digital's website can benefit from possibly taking the logo outside of laying on top of the carousel. Sometimes it could get lost into the background depending on the image being used in the carousel. I do like how when you travel down the page the menu and logo become smaller and stay static at the top of the webpage.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

		<p>Similarities:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The use of white negative space.</li>
			<li>The use of a carousel above the fold before the user has to scroll down the page.</li>
			<li>A three columns grid layout to display their most recent work and their clients.</li>
			<li>On the homepage, call to actions and office locations at the bottom of the page. This is the last object that the user sees on the page.</li>
			<li>Both websites use responsive design where the objects on the page resize automatically if itâ€™s being displayed on a mobile or tablet device.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Differences:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Frank Digital content is all on the same page, if the user selects an option from the menu the webpage automatically scrolls down to the relative content.</li>
			<li>Bang website when the user selects an option from the menu it takes the user to a new webpage.</li>
		</ul>
